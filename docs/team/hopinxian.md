## Project: VirusTracker

**VirusTracker is a desktop application to generate Covid-19 related statistics.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
VirusTracker helps users manage lists of people, locations and visits relevant to the pandemic.
